Technical Stack
•	Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (Shadcn UI optional)
•	Backend: Google Sheets API for the bookstore database
•	Hosting: Vercel
•	Initial prototype: Replit
Development Process
I'm looking to start with building a prototype on Replit focused on the core frontend components. After validating the design and user experience, I'll need help integrating the Supabase backend and implementing the full feature set.
Database Structure
I have an existing database of bookstore information with the following fields:
•	ID

•	Street
•	City
•	State
•	Zip
•	Description
•	Image URL
•	Website
•	Phone number
The complete database schema is detailed in the technical specification document.
Deliverables
For the initial Replit prototype:
1.	Homepage with directory-focused design
2.	Interactive map component (basic version)
3.	Bookstore listing page with filtering
4.	Bookstore detail page template
5.	Basic navigation and responsive design
For the full implementation:
1.	Complete frontend implementation

5.	Newsletter signup functionality
6.	SEO optimization including programmatic page generation

Additional Information
Please refer to the attached technical specification document for comprehensive details on all aspects of the project, including database schema, API endpoints, component architecture, and development phases.
I'm not a developer myself, so I'm looking for someone who can take this specification and implement it with minimal technical guidance from me. I'm open to suggestions for improvements to the technical approach based on your expertise.
